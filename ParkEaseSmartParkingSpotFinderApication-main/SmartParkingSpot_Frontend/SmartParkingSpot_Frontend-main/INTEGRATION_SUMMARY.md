- âœ… All dependencies installed successfully

---

## ðŸ”§ 2. API Configuration Created

### New Files Created:

1. **`constants/api.ts`**
   - Centralized backend URL configuration
   - Easy to update for different environments

2. **`components/api/axios.ts`**
   - Configured axios instance with base URL
   - Default headers for JSON requests

3. **`components/api/adminParkingSlots.ts`**
   - TypeScript types for parking slots
   - API service functions for admin parking management

---

## ðŸŽ¯ 3. Backend-Integrated Components

### `components/admin/NotificationBell.tsx` âœ¨ NEW

- Unread notification badge
- Mark notifications as read functionality
- Navigation to provider approvals on click

---

## ðŸ“± 4. Backend-Integrated Admin Screens

### `app/(admin)/dashboard.tsx` ðŸ”„ UPDATED
**Before:** Mock data with hardcoded values
**After:** Real backend integration

**Features:**
- Fetches analytics from `/api/admin/analytics`
- Displays real user counts (drivers + providers)
- Shows actual revenue data

- Occupancy donut chart
- Parking duration bar chart
- User growth statistics (drivers, providers, total)
- Top providers list

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /api/admin/analytics`
- `GET /api/admin/analytics/parking-duration`

### `app/(admin)/providers.tsx` âœ¨ NEW
**Provider management screen with:**
- List all providers with status
- Approve pending providers
- Reject pending providers
- Suspend approved providers
- Reactivate suspended providers

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /api/admin/providers`

---

## ðŸ“š 5. Documentation Created

### `BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md` âœ¨ NEW
Comprehensive guide including:
- Overview of all changes
- API endpoints documentation
- Authentication setup
- Running instructions
- **Important:** Mobile testing guide (localhost vs IP address)
- Troubleshooting section
- Next steps for driver/provider integration
- Testing checklist

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Start Backend Server
Make sure your Java Spring Boot backend is running:
```bash
cd "c:\JAVA Springboard Internship\current work 06\smartParkingProjectFontendandBackend-main\backend"
# Run your Spring Boot application
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd "c:\JAVA Springboard Internship\current work 06\SmartParkingSpot_Frontend\SmartParkingSpot_Frontend-main"
npm start
```

### 3. Choose Platform
- Press `a` for Android emulator
- Press `i` for iOS simulator
- Scan QR code with Expo Go app for physical device

---

## âš ï¸ Important Notes

### For Physical Device Testing (Expo Go App)

If testing on your phone, you **MUST** update the backend URL:

1. Find your computer's IP address:
   ```bash
   ipconfig  # Windows
   ```

2. Update these files:
   - `constants/api.ts`
   - `components/api/axios.ts`

   Change from:
   ```typescript
   const BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080";
   ```
   
   To (example):
   ```typescript
   const BASE_URL = "http://10.67.158.172:8080";  // Your computer's IP
   ```

3. Ensure phone and computer are on the **same Wi-Fi network**

### For Emulator/Simulator Testing
- **Android Emulator**: Use `http://10.67.158.172:8080`
- **iOS Simulator**: Use `http://localhost:8080`

## ðŸŽ‰ Summary

Your SmartParkingSpot_Frontend project now has:
1. âœ… Working backend integration for admin panel
2. âœ… Real-time data fetching from Spring Boot API
3. âœ… Proper API configuration and structure
4. âœ… TypeScript types for type safety
5. âœ… Comprehensive documentation
6. âœ… All dependencies installed

The admin panel is now fully functional with backend integration. The driver and provider panels still use mock data and will need similar integration following the same pattern.
